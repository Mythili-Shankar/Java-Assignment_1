The Employee Payroll System is a menu-driven Java application developed to manage employee salary details efficiently. This project demonstrates the practical implementation of core Java concepts such as classes and objects, constructors, access modifiers, method overloading, file handling, and exception handling.
The system allows users to add employee details including Employee ID, Name, and Basic Salary. Based on the basic salary entered, the program automatically calculates salary components such as House Rent Allowance (HRA), Dearness Allowance (DA), and Net Salary. HRA is calculated as 20% of the basic salary, and DA is calculated as 10%. The Net Salary is computed as the sum of Basic Salary, HRA, and DA.
All employee records are stored permanently using file handling techniques. The application uses FileWriter and BufferedWriter to store data, and FileReader and BufferedReader to retrieve stored records. This ensures that employee information is preserved even after the program is closed.
The system also provides a search functionality that allows users to find employee details using their Employee ID. Proper exception handling is implemented to manage errors such as missing files or invalid input, making the application robust and user-friendly.
The application follows an object-oriented design by separating employee data and operations within an Employee class. Constructors are used to initialize objects, and method overloading is implemented in the display function to demonstrate flexibility.
